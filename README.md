# A simple Express-React-Typescript template with Wepback

This is a simple template in Typescript with a basic setup of Webpack that bundles an Express app that serves a basic React app with Sass.

To run (you need yarn to run the default scripts):

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Rename example.env to .env and add your custom port if you want to
4. Run **one** following batches of scripts:

- (Easiest) Run "yarn dev"
- (Highly recommended) Run the following commands in parallel:
  - yarn dev:client
  - yarn dev:server
  - yarn dev:run:server
